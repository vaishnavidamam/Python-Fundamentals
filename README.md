# 🐍 Python Fundamentals – Bootcamp Learning  

This repository is part of my *Data Analyst Bootcamp journey* where I practiced Python basics with examples and a mini project.  

## 📘 Topics Covered  
- Printing & Variables  
- Data Types (int, float, string, list, tuple, set, dict, bool)  
- Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Membership)  
- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)  
- Loops (for, while, nested loops)  
- Functions  
- Type Conversion  
- Collections Operations (append, update, slicing, etc.)  

## 🎯 Mini Project – BMI Calculator  

A simple program that calculates *Body Mass Index (BMI)* using user inputs and classifies the result.

*Example Input:*
Enter your name: Vaishnavi  
Enter your weight in pounds: 110  
Enter your height in inches: 65 

*Example Output:*
Your BMI is: 18.3  
Vaishnavi, you are underweight.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone this repo  
2. Open the .py or .ipynb file in your editor  
3. Run the program and provide inputs  

## 🔮 Next Steps  
- Explore file handling in Python  
- Work with libraries like NumPy & Pandas  
- Apply Python in data analysis projects
